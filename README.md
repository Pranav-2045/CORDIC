# CORDIC
Pipelined CORDIC Engine in VerilogThis repository contains a synthesizable, 16-bit, 16-stage pipelined CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) engine written in Verilog. It is designed to calculate the sine and cosine of a given input angle with high throughput, making it ideal for applications in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and communications.The primary advantage of the CORDIC algorithm is its ability to compute trigonometric functions using only simple hardware components: adders, subtractors, and bit-shifters. It completely avoids the need for complex and resource-intensive multipliers.üìñ What is CORDIC?CORDIC is an elegant algorithm that calculates trigonometric functions by performing a series of micro-rotations.Imagine a vector pointing along the x-axis (x=1, y=0). To find cos(Œ∏) and sin(Œ∏), we can simply rotate this vector by the angle Œ∏. The final coordinates of the vector's tip will be (x' = cos(Œ∏), y' = sin(Œ∏)).Instead of performing one large, complex rotation, CORDIC performs a sequence of smaller, progressively finer rotations. The "trick" is that the angles of these micro-rotations are chosen to be arctan(2‚Åª‚Å±), which simplifies the rotation math to simple bit-shifts.The core iterative equations are:x[i+1] = x[i] - d[i] * y[i] * 2‚Åª‚Å±y[i+1] = y[i] + d[i] * x[i] * 2‚Åª‚Å±z[i+1] = z[i] - d[i] * arctan(2‚Åª‚Å±)Where d is the direction of rotation, chosen at each step to make the remaining angle z approach zero.‚ú® FeaturesPipelined Architecture: The design is fully pipelined with 16 stages, allowing it to accept a new angle on every clock cycle after the initial pipeline fill. This results in a very high throughput of 1 result/cycle.Fixed-Point Arithmetic: Uses a 16-bit signed Q2.14 fixed-point format for all calculations, providing a good balance between precision and hardware cost.Multiplier-less Design: True to the CORDIC algorithm, the datapath contains no hardware multipliers.Configurable: Key parameters like DATA_WIDTH and ITERATIONS can be easily adjusted.Synthesizable: The code is written in a synthesizable subset of Verilog and is ready for implementation on FPGAs or ASICs.Comprehensive Testbench: Includes a self-checking testbench that verifies the output against expected values for several angles.üõ†Ô∏è Hardware ArchitectureThe module is composed of three main parts:Angle Look-Up Table (LUT): A small, hardcoded ROM that stores the pre-calculated arctan(2‚Åª‚Å±) constants required for each iteration.Control Unit: A simple state machine (FSM) that manages the flow of data. It handles the start signal, initializes the pipeline, and asserts the done signal when a calculation is complete.Pipelined Datapath: This is the core of the engine. It consists of 16 physical stages, where each stage contains:Two barrel shifters (for the * 2‚Åª‚Å± operation).Three adders/subtractors (to calculate the next x, y, and z).Pipeline registers to hold the results between stages.üî¢ Fixed-Point RepresentationThis implementation uses a Q2.14 signed fixed-point format. For a 16-bit number, this means:1 bit for the sign (S)1 bit for the integer part (I)14 bits for the fractional part (F) S .  I  . FFFFFFFFFFFFFF

This format can represent numbers from -2.0 to +1.999...Angle Scaling:To work with this format, angles are scaled such that 90¬∞ (or œÄ/2 radians) corresponds to the integer value 16384 (which is 1.0 in Q2.14).+90¬∞ ‚Üí +16384+45¬∞ ‚Üí +8192-30¬∞ ‚Üí -5461The testbench (tb_cordic.v) handles this conversion automatically.üìÇ File Structure.
